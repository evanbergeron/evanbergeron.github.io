I study math and computer science at **Carnegie Mellon**. I TA the course 15-112, an intensive introductory programming course. I'm working at **HP Vertica** this summer as a Software intern. I have **[a blog](http://dfa.io)**. I like cs theory, discrete math, and Chinese teas.

You can get in contact with me at ebergeron@cmu.edu or view my github [here](http://github.com/evanbergeron).
