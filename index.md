I study math and computer science at **Carnegie Mellon**. I'm currently interning at **HP Vertica** working on database backup and restore to HDFS. I've previously TA-d CMU's intensive introductory programming course, 15-112. I have **[a blog](http://dfa.io)**. In my spare time, I like to program for fun, practice my Chinese, and explore the city with friends.
