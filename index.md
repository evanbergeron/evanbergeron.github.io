I'm a rising senior at CMU, studying math and computer science. I'm very excited to be doing compilers stuff at **[MemSQL](http://memsql.com)** this summer and TA-ing CMU's undergraduate compilers class this fall. I maintain a small tech **[blog](http://dfa.io)**. When I'm not doing school, I enjoy programming for fun, practicing my Chinese, and exploring the city with friends.

You can get in contact with me at ebergeron@cmu.edu or view my github [here](http://github.com/evanbergeron).
