I study math and computer science at **Carnegie Mellon**. This summer, I'll be interning at **HP Vertica** as a software intern. I've previously TA-d CMU's intensive introductory programming course, 15-112. I have **[a blog](http://dfa.io)**. In my spare time, I like to program for fun, practice my Chinese, and explore the city with friends.

You can get in contact with me at ebergeron@cmu.edu or view my github [here](http://github.com/evanbergeron).
