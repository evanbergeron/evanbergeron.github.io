I'm a junior studying math and computer science at **Carnegie Mellon**. I like systems and CS theory. I've very excited to be interning at **[MemSQL](http://memsql.com)** this summer. I've TA-d introductory math and computer science classes (CMU's 21-127 and 15-112). I have **[a blog](http://dfa.io)**. In my spare time, I like to program for fun, practice my Chinese, and explore the city with friends.

You can get in contact with me at ebergeron@cmu.edu or view my github [here](http://github.com/evanbergeron).
