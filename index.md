I'm a senior at CMU, studying math and computer science. I had a blast working at **[MemSQL](http://memsql.com)** this past summer. I maintain a small tech **[blog](http://dfa.io)**. When I'm not doing school, I enjoy programming for fun, practicing my Chinese, and exploring the city with friends.

You can get in contact with me at ebergeron@cmu.edu or view my github [here](http://github.com/evanbergeron).
