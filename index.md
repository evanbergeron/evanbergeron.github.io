I'm a junior studying math and computer science at **Carnegie Mellon**. This past summer, I interned at **HP Vertica**, where I implemented backup and restore tasks to HDFS. I'm currently TA-ing **Concepts of Mathematics**. I've previously TA-d **15-112**, an intensive introductory programming course. I have **[a blog](http://dfa.io)**. In my spare time, I like to program for fun, practice my Chinese, and explore the city with friends.
