Boolean Expressions and Their Value

Edsger Dijkstra has suggested that the programming language ALGOL 60 was the first programming language to make the distinction that a boolean expression wasn't simply something that was "right" or "wrong," but that it had a value - true or false.

It's interesting to think that booleans weren't always first-class citizens. Not only in prorgamming and computer science, but mathematically as well. 

> How great that step was I learned from my mother’s reaction. She was a gifted mathematician, but she could not make that step. For her, “three plus five is ten” was not a complicated way of saying “false”; it was just wrong.

In modern discrete math classes, we are taught about quantified boolean formula statements that hold the value true or false. It's odd that we didn't always view them in that light.

Funny how far this idea has come now. We've got TQBF as the canonical PSPACE representative and the whole field of boolean algebra. Pretty cool.
