title: Spilling out Infinities
---
It's really interesting to think that \N^n is countable, yet the set of all binary strings is uncountable. 

Think of them as matricies:

N^n would have finitely many (say,) columns, but an infinite number of rows. It'd sort of be this infinite column of width n. And that column has coutable size.

The set of all binary strings is like a matrix with 2 rows and infinitely many columns. Yet is uncountable.

What if you thought of the infinite binary strings as encodings of numbers? I'm imagining some computer racing along this infinite string, adding continuely arbitrarily high numbers to an already ginormous number. Forever. It feels like there too many options to count. (We know there are of course). As we race along all the different strings, different paths to infinity spill all over the place, too quick to grab and count.

Cool.
