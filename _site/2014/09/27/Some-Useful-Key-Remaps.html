    <p>Caps-Lock -&gt; Escape and Shift keys when tapped -&gt; left and right parens.</p>

<p>Both of these were inspired by Steve Losh’s infamous <a href="http://stevelosh.com/blog/2012/10/a-modern-space-cadet/">A Modern Space Cadet</a> article. Months ago I followed the instructions to remap my caps-lock key and shift keys as instructed. I lived happily for many months.</p>

<p>But then I switched to linux and was unable to find similar instructions for linux. I found a couple lone souls out there trying to remap keys using xmodmap. But xmodmap (as far as I can tell) can’t tell how long you hold down the keys for. I found a couple of hacks, but nothing worked for me.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://github.com/alols/xcape">xcape</a>. I cloned from github and entered</p>

<p><code>
./xcape -e 'Shift_L=Shift_L|parenleft'
./xcape -e 'Shift_R=Shift_R|parenright'
./xcape -e 'Caps_Lock=Escape'
</code></p>

<p>And viola. My main complaint about switching to linux was rectified. Hopefully this helps someone else out there as well :).</p>
